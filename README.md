# The Tech Blog

  ## Description

  All developers need a place to discuss topics related to Computer Science. With an ever changing coding landscape the tech blog provides a place for developers to go to share new ideas. The application is built for any experience level and the interface is extremely simple. The goal of this app should be to bring people together to share information. It uses both front end and backend technologies. While coding this application I learned a great deal about MVC concepts and handlebars.
